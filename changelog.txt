2.0 -
The package is no longer connected to the external javascript file in github.
Because of the above, it now works on mobile. I recommend using only for light hunting as it will lag after a while and may not be able to keep up with tougher areas.
You WILL have to change the script for your bashing button. The instructions in the readme have been updated.
You can now use your bashing button to both start AND STOP bashing. This makes fleeing a million times easier.
